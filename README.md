# hello-world

I just started to learn about coding, my first steps were learning html and a bit of javascript. Now I want to learn some Languages (Java and then Dart) to crate my own apps for android.
I plan to use flutter with Git and Android Studio, the editor I want to use is VS (Visual Studio Code)
Wish me luck, I'll try my best!
